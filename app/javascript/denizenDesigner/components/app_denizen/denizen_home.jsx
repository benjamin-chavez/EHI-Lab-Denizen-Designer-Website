            The Denizen Designer Project documents the insights and experiences
            of individuals and collectives who have engaged design as a way to
            address social, economic, or political challenges in their local
            environments. We interviewed people from this project who come from
            a variety of backgrounds ranging from graphic design to architecture
            and consulting. Although their backgrounds and interpretations of
            design may be different, there is a common theme that participatory
            design and community work are fundamental aspects to ethical and
            transformative design. We hope these interviews bring more awareness
            to this type of work and a stronger network of Denizen Designers
            will be formed.{" "}
